## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. Node.js 20+ and npm
2. Docker and Docker Compose (for production / full stack)
3. Playwright browsers for E2E tests: `npx playwright install`

### Clone and checkout

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd lavis-ui
git checkout main
```

### Run the full stack (backend + frontend)

```bash
docker compose up
```

Frontend: [http://localhost:5180](http://localhost:5180)
Backend API: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

Default credentials: `alice` / `bob` / `charlie` — password `1234`.

---

## Development

### Frontend only (API proxied to backend)

If the backend is running separately (e.g. via `docker compose up backend`):

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173). Vite proxies `/api` to the backend.

API base URL: Set `VITE_API_URL` in `.env` (e.g. `http://localhost:8080`) if the backend is not on the same origin.

### Backend only

```bash
./backend/larvis
# Or custom port: ./backend/larvis -addr :9090
```

Backend listens on port 8080 by default.

---

## Production Deployment

### Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

1. Frontend: Served by nginx on port 5180
2. Backend: Runs on port 8080
3. Frontend nginx proxies `/api/` to `http://backend:8080/`

### Manual build (frontend)

```bash
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run build
```

Output: `frontend/dist`. Serve with any static file server (e.g. nginx) and configure the API base URL if needed.

### Environment variables

1. VITE_API_URL — API base URL (dev / preview), default /api

In production (Docker), /api is resolved by nginx and proxied to the backend.

---

## Testing

### Unit tests (Jest)

```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

1. npm test — Run unit tests
2. npm run test:watch — Watch mode
3. npm run test:coverage — Coverage report

### E2E tests (Playwright)

E2E tests mock the LARVIS API; no backend required.

```bash
cd frontend
npx playwright install   # First time: install browsers
npm run test:e2e
```

1. npm run test:e2e — All browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit, Mobile)
2. npm run test:e2e:chromium — Chromium only (faster)
3. npm run test:e2e:ui — Interactive UI mode
4. npm run test:e2e:visual — Visual regression tests only
5. npm run test:e2e:update-snapshots — Update visual snapshots

Port: `PLAYWRIGHT_PORT` (default 5180). Playwright starts the dev server automatically.

Coverage: Auth (login, logout, validation), form validation, navigation, API mocking, visual regression, mobile (Pixel 5).

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

GitHub Actions workflow: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

Triggers: Push and pull requests to `main`

Steps:

| Step   | Command                     | Purpose              |
|--------|-----------------------------|----------------------|
| Lint   | `npm run lint`              | ESLint               |
| Unit   | `npm test`                  | Jest unit tests      |
| Build  | `npm run build`             | TypeScript + Vite    |
| E2E    | `npm run test:e2e:chromium` | Playwright (Chromium)|

All run in `frontend/` on Node 20. E2E uses Playwright’s built-in dev server and mocked API.

### Folder structure notes

1. app/ — Layout, auth context, theme, routing; runs once at app startup.
2. pages/ — Compositions that arrange features into screens.
3. features/ — Business logic and UI per domain (auth, acquisitions, reports, users, settings). Follows simplified Feature-Sliced Design; features only import from shared.
4. shared/ — Reusable UI, API client, utils, types; no business logic.
5. e2e/ — Playwright specs and helpers; API is mocked.

## Backend Improvement Suggestions

The LARVIS API is provided as a pre-compiled binary. The following improvements would make it more production-ready and secure:

### Security

1. Password storage: Plaintext passwords returned in GET /users/:id. Recommendation: Never return passwords; store and compare using bcrypt/argon2. Hash on create/update.
2. JWT: Likely minimal claims and long expiry. Recommendation: Short expiry (15–30 min), refresh tokens, include sub, exp, iat; validate signature and claims server-side.
3. Auth model: Single shared secret for all users. Recommendation: Per-user credentials, role-based access if needed.
4. HTTPS/SSL: Service runs over HTTP. Recommendation: Use HTTPS in production; terminate TLS at load balancer or reverse proxy, or enable SSL/TLS on the service.
5. CORS: Unknown. Recommendation: Explicit Access-Control-Allow-Origin for known frontend origins.
6. Rate limiting: None. Recommendation: Rate limit /token, /users, /acquisitions to reduce brute-force and abuse.

### Validation & error handling

1. Input validation: Minimal. Recommendation: Validate body/query; enforce length, format, types; reject invalid input early.
2. Error responses: Likely inconsistent. Recommendation: Standard JSON errors with correct HTTP status codes (400, 401, 403, 404, 500).
3. Validation messages: Unclear. Recommendation: Clear, safe messages for clients; avoid leaking internals.

### Schema & API design

1. Field naming: sites in docs vs ore_sites in response. Recommendation: Align docs and response schema; use OpenAPI/Swagger for source of truth.
2. Pagination: /acquisitions returns ~300 items. Recommendation: Add limit and offset (or cursor) for scalability.
3. Filtering: None. Recommendation: Add from and to for acquisitions; search for users if needed.
4. Versioning: None. Recommendation: Path prefix or header versioning for backward compatibility.

### Operational

1. Health checks: Unknown. Recommendation: GET /health or /ready for liveness/readiness probes.
2. Logging: Unknown. Recommendation: Structured logs (request id, user, status, duration) without sensitive data.
3. Metrics: None. Recommendation: Basic metrics (latency, error rate) for monitoring and alerting.

### Data & storage

1. Persistence: Likely in-memory. Recommendation: Use a database (Postgres, SQLite) for users and acquisitions.
2. Idempotency: Unknown. Recommendation: Idempotency keys for POST updates where applicable.

### Scaling and high-volume data

As satellites and data volume grow, the current design (unknown) may hit limits. Possible improvements, assuming typical constraints:

1. Async ingestion via message queue (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
2. Time-series storage (TimescaleDB, InfluxDB, ClickHouse)
3. Partitioning and retention policies
4. Separate transactional DB for users vs time-series for acquisitions
5. Pagination, cursors, range filters, streaming for exports
6. Caching (e.g. Redis) for pre-computed stats
7. Read/write separation and replicas
8. Event-driven model, optional CQRS
9. Observability: tracing, metrics, structured logging
10. Backpressure and rate limiting at ingest

## Frontend Enhancements (Future)

If there were more time, the frontend could be improved with:

1. UX polish: Better animations, transitions, accessibility (ARIA, keyboard nav)
2. Responsiveness: Further mobile layout tuning, larger tap targets
3. Advanced viz: More chart types, drill-downs, zoom/pan
4. State management: TanStack Query if more complex data flows or caching are needed
5. Offline / PWA: Service worker, basic offline support
6. i18n: Localization for multiple languages
7. E2E against real API: Optional job using docker compose to test against the real backend
